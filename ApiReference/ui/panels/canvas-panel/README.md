------|------------
[CanvasPanel](../../../ui/panels/canvas-panel/CanvasPanel.md) | CanvasPanel is used to place child elements at arbitrary positions or to draw children in multiple layers.
Child positions are computed from the left, top properties.
The order that children are drawn (z-order) is determined exclusively by child order.
